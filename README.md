# lda-qda-knn-lr-analysis

This project is divided into two parts. The first part analyzed the MBA dataset with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). The objective is to use the GPA and GMAT scores to predict the likelihood of admission, Decision (admit, not admit, and borderline). The second part analyzed the default dataset that could be found in the ISLR library. The objective is to predict whether an individual will default on his or her credit card payment, on the basis of annual income ($1000), monthly credit card balance ($) and if the person is a student or not. One utilized LDA, QDA, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Logistic Regression (LR) in this part and attempted to compare those methods in order to find the model that fits the data best.
